# Display
We have several types of display and here we will cover the basics
- block
- inline
- inline-block

## block
Each element selected by the selector will have width as its relative parent. in other words a whole line, next element will be under it.
```css
div {
  display: block;
}
```

## inline
Each element defined by the selector will be placed in a line with its siblings width and height will be ignored
```css
div {
  display: inline;
}
```
## inline-block
Each element defined by the selector will be placed in a line with its siblings width and height take effect
```css
div {
  display: inline-block;
}
```

# Advanced types
Each of those is a subject in and of itself and we will take some look at those later
- flex
- table
- grid
